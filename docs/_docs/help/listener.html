<h1>Listeners</h1>
Listeners receive messages from external systems. A separate listener implementation is needed
for each supported protocol (eg: REST, SOAP, Kafka, JMS, etc).  The key design concepts of the MDW listener
pattern are spelled out here.
<ul>
	<li>
		Listeners are protocol-specific, and implement the bare minimum functionality to accept messages off
		the wire.  Real processing is delegated to protocol-independent <a href="handlers.html">Request Handlers</a>.
		This allows handlers to be used across protocols, and to focus on business requirements instead of protocol details.
	</li>
	<li>
		The responsibilities of a Listener include creating a string value representing the request content, and to
		populate a <code>Map&lt&ltString,String>></code> containing protocol headers, or <code>metaInfo</code>.
		Listeners can call <a href="../javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/listener/ListenerHelper.html#processRequest-java.lang.String-java.util.Map-">ListenerHelper.processRequest()</a>
		to invoke the appropriate handler.  A listener must also populate response content and response headers based on
		string values provided by the handler.
	</li>
	<li>
		MDW provides listeners for many common protocols (listed below).  Usually an MDW application should implement
		one or more <a href="handlers.html">Request Handlers</a> instead of a listener.  The use case for implementing
		a custom listener is when a required protocol is missing from the built-in list.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Camel Routes</h2>
An alternative approach to MDW's Listener/Handler pattern is to process external requests through
<a href="https://camel.apache.org/">Apache Camel</a>.  This approach can be especially useful when no built-in
protocol Listener is available, or when Camel's advanced message filtering capabilities are needed.
See the MDW <a href="MDWCamelIntegration.html">Camel Routes</a> documentation for details.

<h2>Built-In Listeners</h2>

<h3>RESTful Service Listener</h3>
MDW's REST listener handles three types of HTTP requests:
<ul>
	<li>
		Requests whose paths start with <code>&ltcontext-root>/REST</code> are mapped to handlers by path or
		by content as described in the <a href="handlers.html">Request Handlers documentation</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		Applications can expose a REST endpoint through the JAX-RS <code>@Path</code> annotation as described
		in the MDW Cookbook's section on
		<a href="../guides/mdw-cookbook/#implement-a-jax-rs-rest-endpoint">exposting a REST endpoint</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		Workflow processes can be registered to directly handle REST endpoint paths.  See the relevant section
		of the <a href="process.html#requestPathRegistration">process documentation</a> for details.
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Document (SOAP) Web Service Listener</h3>
MDW includes a number of prebuilt, extensible options for hosting SOAP Web services.
See the <a href="../guides/SOAPService/">SOAP Web Service</a> documentation for details.

To expose document-literal style services using a custom WSDL definition, MDW provides a mechanism whereby the WSDL document is created as an <a href="assets.html">asset</a>.
An HTTP GET request against a custom WSDL asset called Employee looks like:<br/>http://localhost:8080/mdw/services/SOAP/Employee.wsdl<br/><br/>
A similar URL can be used as the endpoint for an HTTP POST request which will invoke the service.
In this case the request is unwrapped from the SOAP envelope, and based on the top-level element the usual message pattern matching procedure is followed.
Likewise, the response content is presumed to be XML and is inserted into a SOAP envelope.
<br/><br/>
The endpoint location in the WSDL asset can be parameterized as follows based on environment-specific property settings:<br/>
 &lt;soap:address location="${mdw.services.url}/SOAP/Employee.wsdl" /&gt;

<h3>RPC SOAP Listener</h3>
MDW has a standard <a href="https://github.com/CenturyLinkCloud/mdw/blob/master/mdw-workflow/assets/com/centurylink/mdw/base/MdwRpcWebService.wsdl">WSDL</a>/endpoint
for handling SOAP RPC requests at <code>&ltcontext-root>/SOAP/MDWWebService</code>.


<h3>Kafka Listener</h3>
The Kafka listener is provided in an optional asset package:<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/CenturyLinkCloud/mdw/blob/master/mdw-workflow/assets/com/centurylink/mdw/kafka/readme.md">
	https://github.com/CenturyLinkCloud/mdw/blob/master/mdw-workflow/assets/com/centurylink/mdw/kafka/readme.md
</a>

<h3>JMS Listener</h3>
External JMS messages are handled through the <code>com.centurylink.mdw.external.event.queue</code>.
